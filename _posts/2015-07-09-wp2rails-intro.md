While going through the RSpec Book, I felt the need to apply what I've been learning to a project. I have several WordPress sites I maintain and am looking to change them over to Rails sites. I will be working on converting them while ensuring that I follow a TDD approach with Cucumber and RSpec. I will also be blogging about the process.

My initial plan is to:

1. Migrate data from WordPress into a form that is usable by Active Record.
2. Duplicate and update the UI by converting templates, JS and CSS. 
3. Find suitable gems to replace plugins and functionality from WordPress.
4. If no suitable gem is available, code my own solutions.

Any comments, as always, are appreciated.
