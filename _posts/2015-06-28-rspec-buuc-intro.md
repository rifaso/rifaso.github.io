One of my goal's is to get better at testing my code using RSpec. To do so, I decided to pick up '[The RSpec Book][rspec-book]'. I will be going through the book, however since the versions of Ruby and Gems used throughout the book are outdated, I will be updating the code samples to be inline with current versions of Ruby and Gems. I will be calling this project the RSpec Book Unofficial Updated Code or RSpec Buuc.

The RSpec Book Ruby and Gem Versions are:

* ruby-1.8.7
* rubygems- 1.3.7
* rspec-2.0.0
* cucumber-0.9.2
* cumcumber-rails-0.3.2
* database_claener-0.5.2
* webrat-0.7.2
* selenium-client-1.2.18
* rails-3.0.0
            
The RSpec Buuc Ruby and Gem version I will be using are:

* ruby-2.2.2
* rubygems-2.4.8
* rspec-3.3.0
* cucumber-2.0.0
* cumcumber-rails-1.4.2
* database_claener-1.4.1
* webrat-0.7.3
* selenium-client-2.9.9
* rails-4.2.3

I am doing this primarily for myself and my own learning. I am sharing and doing this publically in hopes that  it may be useful to others. 

I am by no means an expert, so any feedback would be appreciated. 

All code for the RSpec Buuc can be found at this [GitHub repo][rspec-buuc-repo].
