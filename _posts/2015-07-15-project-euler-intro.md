So I came across the [Project Euler website][project-euler] today. There are over 500 math problems to be solved using computers. I will be solving these for two reasons. 

..1. To practive breaking down problems. 
..2. To practice refactoring after I solve the problem. 

I will be posting all my code and tests at this [GitHub repo][gh-pe].

If you notice any areas where I can refactor or any edge cases I've missed please feel free to comment.
