So I came across the [Project Euler website][project-euler] today. There are over 500 math problems to be solved using computers. I will be solving these for two reasons. 

1. To practive breaking down problems using TDD.
2. To practice refactoring. 

With that said, though I could, I will not be golfing my answers. The goal is clean, readable, maintainable, and extensible code.

I will be posting all my code and tests at this [GitHub repo][gh-pe]. Also, I will be blogging about my process to solve each problem as I complete them.

If you notice any areas where I can refactor or any edge cases I've missed please feel free to comment.
