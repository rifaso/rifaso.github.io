Today I'm sitting here at RedDotRuby Conf 2015 in Singapore, It's lunch time. But I'm spending my time writing this instead of socializing with people. This is my second year at the conference and I feel like I'm in a very similar place to last year. I started learning Ruby in January of 2014. I went through a couple of different websites and picked up enough were I felt like at least I understood enough about the language so I could attend the conference last year. I left the conference very excited and wanted to work at it for the next year to the point where I could qualify to get a job hopefully at the conference this year. This conference. Unfortunately, life happens and after a year, though I did work on my code, I don't have a single completed project to demonstrate or illustrate my skills. 

Yesterday one of the speakers spoke of Refatoring Yourself and she was illustrating the coorelatiion between refactoring your code and refactoring yourself. This is something I have continually struggled with. Change. How to make long term change. Short term change is easy but how do you make those changes premenant? Even though I don't have the answer. Something she said made me think. I'm goind to paraphrese here. She said it doesn't have to be perfect. You will never be perfect, but you can keep learning, growing and improving. 

So, in the attempt to learn, grow and improve, I am committing right now that I will code everyday and commit code everyday in the attempt to (1) imporve my skills and abilities, (2) To have a completed project to show off my code. (3) Do all this to eventually make my families life better.
